# HarmonyHub-SwiftUI
HarmonyHub is here with brand new features.This is the updated version of my latest app HarmonyHub.It's powered by SwiftUI !

I have built HarmonyHub with UIKit firstly.Now I am trying to convert it to a SwiftUI app.
I coded it again with the SwiftUI framework, adding new features to the project with simplified code architecture such as creating UI, data flow, algorithms and many more.In addition, I have used MVVM architecture instead of VIPER.
