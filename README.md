# HarmonyHub-SwiftUI
HarmonyHub is here with brand new features.This is the updated version of my latest app HarmonyHub.It's powered by SwiftUI ! I built in 5 days this app.It means SwiftUI is 6x faster than UIKit
<h1>New Features</h1>
⭐️ Favorites Screen -> You can add playlists, albums and tracks to your favorite list.These are stored in userdefaults <br>
⭐️ Animations -> I have added some scroll animations with SwiftUI<br>
⭐️ More Basic AudioManager -> AudioManager is more readable and easy to use now.<br>

<h1>🎬Overall</h1>
HarmonyHub is an application that ensures users enjoy a rich and delightful music experience from every aspect. You can discover newly released albums, the most popular songs, specially curated playlists, and much more. You can search for and find any song you're looking for, listen to songs, and experience this unique journey without any limitations.Also I added "Favorites" feature to app.You can add your favorite albums,playlists and tracks to your Favorite List.
<h1>🛠️Technical Details</h1>
I have written the project entirely in accordance with the MVVM architecture. Data transfer and flow are handled through the ViewModel. I have segmented all layers according to their responsibilities, isolating logic operations from the View-related parts. UI-related components have been broken down into the smallest units to achieve a readable and testable code architecture. Separate classes have been created for playing audio, handling internet requests, and managing the favorites list using UserDefaults. Singleton design pattern has been employed in these classes. As a result, a project has been developed that is testable, readable, and easily refactorable.
